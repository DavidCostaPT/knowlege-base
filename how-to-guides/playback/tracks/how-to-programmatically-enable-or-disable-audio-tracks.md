# How to programmatically enable or disable audio tracks
This article describes how you can use the MediaTrack API to enable or disable audio tracks.
The AudioTrack API, which is a sub-API of the MediaTrack API, can be used to implement this functionality. 
Implementing this functionality is a common use-case for developers who want to build their own UI to toggle audio languages on and off.
